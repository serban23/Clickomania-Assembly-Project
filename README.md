## üéÆ Game Overview

The goal of the game is to remove all adjacent blocks of the same color in the shortest time possible. When a group of two or more same-colored blocks is clicked, they disappear, and the blocks above fall down to fill the space. The game continues until no more moves are possible. At the end of each round the player enters their name, this information being stored in a log next to their score.
